Bible translations come in variety of different formats, each of them with different use-cases and applications.
If you wanted to build your own bible app today, you'd either have to manually convert text files to a format that is easier to work with or be stuck with just some text.

[We](https://awesomebible.de) are building [a bible app](https://docs.awesomebible.de/myawesomebible/), so we want to create a format that is easy to work with and can scale to as many bible translations as you want.

The Open Bible Project aims to create a standard way of packaging a bible module that can be just plugged into the code you're already writing.
We also want to package various bible translations in this modularized format and licensed under an open license.
